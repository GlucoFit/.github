# Glucofit

Purpose-driven: The GlucoFit app aims to address the rising issue of diabetes in Indonesia by providing an easy-to-use tool that helps users monitor and manage their sugar intake. This is especially crucial for people with busy lifestyles who may not have the time to keep track of their dietary habits. By offering personalized food recipes and automatic glucose counting through image recognition, the app empowers users to make healthier food choices, thereby preventing and managing diabetes more effectively.

Data-driven: Data indicates that excessive sugar consumption is a significant contributor to the increasing prevalence of diabetes in Indonesia. Many individuals are unaware of their daily sugar intake and the associated health risks. GlucoFit leverages data analytics and machine learning to provide accurate and personalized dietary recommendations, making it easier for users to understand and manage their sugar consumption.

Government Reasoning: The Indonesian government has been actively working to combat the growing health crisis posed by diabetes. GlucoFit aligns with these efforts by providing a technological solution that promotes public health awareness and encourages healthier eating habits. The app can potentially reduce the healthcare burden by helping to prevent diabetes and its complications, thereby supporting government initiatives aimed at improving population health.
